# Temperature-and-Humidty-prediction-using-EloquentTinyML-on-ESP32
This work demonstrated the the possibility to predict both temperature and humidity on microcontroller
The steps are as follow:
Import all the libraries in colab
# Create a dataframe with random values
# Split the data into input and output
# Apply standardization to the input and output data
# Split the data into training, validation, and testing data
# Create a model using the Dense layer, Compile the model and fit
# Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format
# Save the converted model
#install  tinymlgen and convert the model using port
#convert the model in cc using xxd command
 -In arduino IDE
 Follow the steps in the file provide.
